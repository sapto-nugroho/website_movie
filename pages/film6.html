<h1>The Revenant</h1>
<p>Synopsis</p>
<b>In 1820s America, frontiersman and fur trapper Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his teenage son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) join a pelt-gathering expedition. However, their party are attacked by Arikara Native Americans, who kill a number of the men. Glass then tries to lead the remainder of the group to safety, charting a new path to a U.S. fort. Unfortunately, he is soon mauled by a grizzly bear while hunting for food, and is horribly wounded. He is left in the care of roughneck John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and the young and inexperienced Jim Bridger (Will Poulter), while Hawk watches on in horror. Fitzgerald betrays him and leaves him buried alive in a shallow grave, but Glass nurses himself back to health and sets out to seek revenge. Alejandro González Iñárritu directed this pulse-pounding epic. (sourcehttps://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-revenant-v597171)
